# Isometric Roblox RPG Map Design Tool

The Isometric Roblox RPG Map Design Tool is a graphical user interface (GUI) program built in Python using the Tkinter library. This development tool is designed to streamline the process of creating intricate maps for grid-based isometric Roblox turn-based RPGs. It employs the power of Matplotlib to provide a visual representation of the map's terrain, making it easier for developers to design and customize game environments. The tool also offers functionalities to modify tile properties, manage units, and save/load map data.

## Features

- **Interactive Map Design:** Create grid-based isometric maps using an intuitive and interactive interface.
- **Terrain Visualization:** Utilize Matplotlib to visualize the terrain of the map, helping you design intricate landscapes.
- **Tile Customization:** Easily highlight and modify tile properties, including height and unit presence.
- **Unit Management:** Assign stats and properties to units placed on the map.
- **Map Data Persistence:** Save and load map data to and from files, allowing for seamless modification and sharing.

## Keybindings

- **Arrow Keys:** Navigate the grid map for precision movement.
- **Space:** Select a tile on the map.
- **Shift + Space:** Perform a region selection for multiple tiles.
- **Mouse Left Click:** Initiate tile selection and focus handling.
- **Mouse Drag:** Perform drag actions on the grid with mouse right click.

## Usage

1. Launch the program.
2. Generate a map with the designed dimensions.
3. Use the arrow keys for navigation and the space key for tile selection.
4. Press Shift + Space for selecting multiple tiles within a region.
5. Left-click on a tile to focus on it.
7. Drag the mouse to perform actions like moving units.
8. Utilize the Unit Frame to manage unit properties.
9. Save and load map data using the provided options.
